Nested scoping: =>  

Scope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name.

Scope can also be Nested. If Engine does not find the variable in the immediate scope it will go one level up that is to the outerscope. I will keep searching for that variable untill it reach to the Global Scope. 

The Engine is performing an LHS look-up and arrives at the top
floor (global Scope) without finding it, and if the program is not running in
"Strict Mode"
note-strictmode
, then the global Scope will create a new variable
of that name in the global scope, and hand it back to Engine

Scope is like a bubbles.
