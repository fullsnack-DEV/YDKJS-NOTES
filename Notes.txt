Nested scoping: =>  

Scope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name.

Scope can also be Nested. If Engine does not find the variable in the immediate scope it will go one level up that is to the outerscope. I will keep searching for that variable untill it reach to the Global Scope.
